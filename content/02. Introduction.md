## Introduction {.page_break_before}
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental bacteria in part of the phylum Actinobacteria, usually found in soil, air, water, or animals [@doi:10.1038/s41579-020-0331-1]. However, in recent years, NTM has become a growing concern in patients with cystic fibrosis (PWCF), responsible for NTM pulmonary disease. Its diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria [2]. NTM prevalence has been reported with a  wide variation (4 - 40 %), with a significant increase in PWCF in the last few years [3â€“5]. NTM occurrence has also been shown to vary with age, ranging from 19% for patients aged 12 to 17 years old to 29% for patients older than 60 in a cohort of PWCF from the United States monitored between 2010 and 2014 [6]. The prevalence of NTM also varies according to geographic region and environmental conditions [5]. The causes involved in NTM increase over the last years are widely discussed and probably associated with a myriad of factors:  (1) the strengthening of NTM virulence, (2) an alteration of host-pathogen interactions, (3) an enhancement of the monitoring of NTM disease, (4) an improvement of the diagnostic procedures and (5) the aging of the CF population [7,8]. The most commonly isolated NTM species in the United States and Europe belong to the Mycobacterium avium complex (M. avium, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium chimaera) and the Mycobacterium abscessus complex (M. abscessus subspecies abscessus, M. abscessus subspecies boletii, and M. abscessus subspecies massiliense) [9].
