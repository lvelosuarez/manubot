## Abstract {.page_break_before}

As ubiquitous, naturally multidrug-resistant, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a growing concern in cystic fibrosis (CF) due to their increasing prevalence in people with CF (PWCF). The pathophysiological process, colonization, and progression of NTM disease still need to be better understood. At the same time, in recent years, the lung microbiome has been shown to be a cornerstone of CF disease progression. This case-control study aims to investigate the lung microbiome associated with NTM infection in PWCF and to explore some potential dysbiosis that may set the stage for NTM colonization, development, and treatment response. We compared the microbiome composition of sputum samples from 36 NTM-positive CF patients and 72 CF NTM-negative controls (1 case versus 2 controls). Slight differences of ɑ-diversity were observed between cases and controls, but no clear stratification was noticed in analyzing β-diversity between NTM-positive and NTM-negative patients. Analyses have highlighted some bacterial taxa, mainly anaerobes, more abundant in NTM-positive patients. Co-occurrence network analysis has helped determine specific interactions of these taxa in specific bacterial communities within the pulmonary microbiome. This article highlights the complexity of polymicrobial interactions within the CF pulmonary microbiome and unveils the potential link between NTM and anaerobes, which should be investigated further.
